# stegnography-project

Maintaining secrecy is very important in a large corporation and because of the intelligent of the hackers it becomes tedious. 
Already we have crypto graphy for transmitting secret information. Even though crypto graphy successfully transmitting secret information, it will give a suspicion to the hackers and it affects unintended users.
Our project, DIGITAL STEGANO GRAPHY overcomes this factor and it gives a solution for transmitting secret formation with out affecting unintended users. 
Stegano graphy uses multimedia data as a covering medium (Covering secret information). By using stegano graphy data (secret information) can hided with in data (multimedia data, here multimedia data is an image) and it can be sent anywhere to transfer the message easily without giving any suspicion to others.


The Project is written using Java language and have used JSwings as UI.
